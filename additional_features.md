# Additional Features for DexAlarms+

This document outlines additional features that could benefit Type 1 diabetics using the DexAlarms+ app. These features extend beyond the core alarm functionality to provide a more comprehensive diabetes management experience.

## Implemented Additional Features

The following additional features have been selected for implementation in DexAlarms+:

### 1. Predictive Alerts
- **Description**: Uses trend data to predict when glucose levels will reach high or low thresholds
- **Benefit**: Provides earlier warnings, allowing users to take preventative action
- **Implementation**: Algorithm analyzes recent glucose readings and rate of change to predict future values
- **Customization**: Adjustable prediction time window (15-60 minutes)

### 2. Smart Snooze
- **Description**: Context-aware snooze functionality that adjusts based on glucose levels and trends
- **Benefit**: Reduces alarm fatigue while maintaining safety
- **Implementation**: Dynamically calculates appropriate snooze duration based on current glucose, trend, and user-defined risk tolerance
- **Customization**: Risk tolerance settings from conservative to relaxed

### 4. Missed Reading Detection
- **Description**: Alerts when the sensor fails to provide readings for a specified period
- **Benefit**: Ensures users are aware of data gaps that could affect treatment decisions
- **Implementation**: Monitors timestamp of readings and triggers alert after user-defined threshold
- **Customization**: Adjustable time threshold for missed readings

### 5. Stealth Mode
- **Description**: Discreet notification options for public situations
- **Benefit**: Maintains privacy while still receiving important alerts
- **Implementation**: Haptic-only alerts or subtle visual indicators
- **Customization**: Quick toggle via widget or control center

### 7. Insulin Dose Reminder
- **Description**: Checks iOS Health app for insulin doses and reminds user if no dose is recorded after high glucose
- **Benefit**: Helps ensure timely insulin administration for high glucose events
- **Implementation**: Integrates with HealthKit to read insulin data and compares with glucose events
- **Customization**: Configurable glucose thresholds and reminder timing

### 8. Hydration Reminders
- **Description**: Suggests increased fluid intake during prolonged high glucose periods
- **Benefit**: Helps prevent dehydration, which can worsen hyperglycemia
- **Implementation**: Triggers after sustained high glucose readings
- **Customization**: Adjustable glucose threshold and duration

### 9. Emergency Contact Integration
- **Description**: Quick access to emergency contacts with glucose data sharing
- **Benefit**: Facilitates faster assistance in emergency situations
- **Implementation**: Pre-configured emergency contacts with optional automatic SMS with glucose data
- **Customization**: Contact list, message template, and automatic triggering conditions

### 10. Apple Watch Complications
- **Description**: Glanceable glucose information on Apple Watch face
- **Benefit**: Convenient access to current glucose levels without opening the app
- **Implementation**: Various complication sizes with current glucose and trend arrow
- **Customization**: Different complication styles and information density options

### 11. Widget Support
- **Description**: iOS home screen widgets showing current glucose and alarm status
- **Benefit**: Quick visual access to glucose information
- **Implementation**: Multiple widget sizes with appropriate information density
- **Customization**: Widget appearance and information display options

### 12. Voice Announcements
- **Description**: Spoken alerts for glucose levels and trends
- **Benefit**: Accessibility feature and hands-free operation
- **Implementation**: Text-to-speech for critical alerts and regular status updates
- **Customization**: Voice selection, announcement frequency, and content

### 13. Glucose Statistics
- **Description**: Basic time-in-range metrics and glucose variability data
- **Benefit**: Helps users understand patterns and improve management
- **Implementation**: Simple statistical analysis of stored glucose data
- **Customization**: Target range settings and reporting period

## Future Feature Considerations

These features were considered but deferred for future development:

### Activity Context
- **Description**: Correlates glucose patterns with activity types
- **Benefit**: Helps users understand how different activities affect glucose levels
- **Reason for deferral**: Requires significant additional development for activity detection and correlation

### Caregiver Remote Monitoring via Local Network
- **Description**: Allows sharing glucose data with caregivers on the same local network
- **Benefit**: Enables monitoring without internet dependency
- **Reason for deferral**: Adds complexity to the initial implementation

### Customizable Target Ranges
- **Description**: Different target ranges for different times of day or activities
- **Benefit**: More personalized glucose management
- **Reason for deferral**: Core alarm functionality covers the essential use cases

### Meal Tagging
- **Description**: Ability to tag meals and see post-meal glucose patterns
- **Benefit**: Helps users understand food impacts on glucose
- **Reason for deferral**: Focuses app more on data entry than core alarm functionality

## Implementation Priority

The additional features will be implemented in the following priority order:

1. Predictive Alerts
2. Missed Reading Detection
3. Apple Watch Complications
4. Widget Support
5. Smart Snooze
6. Insulin Dose Reminder
7. Voice Announcements
8. Stealth Mode
9. Emergency Contact Integration
10. Hydration Reminders
11. Glucose Statistics

This prioritization focuses on features that most directly enhance the core alarm functionality and provide the greatest safety benefits first.
